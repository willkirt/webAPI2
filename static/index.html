    <p>For the list I chose my favorite game series because I find it difficult pick individual games i like most within a series. Each game has its merits and often an individual game may not be as noteable outside of its series to place context and history into what is going on. Therefore I chose these series because they are the ones that I always look forward to playing the game of.
